# Questions

What will you do to ensure your code is readable? For example, will you share your code frequently with your partner? Setup Visual Studio Codeâ€™s auto formatter consistently across group members

> We will use autoformat between all the members to ensure consistency. We will also commit code frequently under different feature branches. Additionally we will use comments and helper methods.


What procedure will you put in place to ensure committed code is functional?

> We will use tests before pushing commited code


How do you plan to test your code?	

> We plan to use MSTest to write unit tests for functions and then run them frequently.


How do you plan to divide the work?

> We will use trello to split up the work.


How will you ensure that your application is robust and does not fail due to user errors?

> We will rigoursly test potential inputs even after the unit tests, and pay close attention to possible edge cases.


How will you ensure you have stand alone classes can be tested?

> By ensuring that our classes and program are as modular as possible and by implementing dependency injection.


Are there any other guidelines or expectations that you would like to ask of one another?

> Not particularly, we're pretty much on the same page.


## Extra Features

The main menu will feature an interactive world map. This map will grey out countries the user already cooked from, can highlight countries the user tells the program they want to cook recipies from someday.

Additionally, there will be a feature that allows developpers to easily implement monthly challenges to the users to cook foods that month based on that month's theme. (ex: coutnries on the silk road, west Asia, countries on the Equator, etc.)

## FAQ

**Nathan:**
- How should the git branches be organized?
- Should every method of the project be tested / how will GUI be tested?

**Andrew:**
- How will the database framework be implemented?
- Where/how will user profile pictures be stored? (file, url, database, ...)
